# Streaming Metadata Analytics Project (2025)

**End-to-end Data Analytics & BI case study focused on streaming content performance and engagement modeling**
*Python • Jupyter • Power BI • Excel*

## Overview

This project simulates a real-world streaming service analytics pipeline, similar to those used by companies such as Netflix, Prime Video, or Gracenote (Nielsen) to analyze content performance and user engagement.

The goal is to demonstrate a complete data analytics workflow, from raw data ingestion to KPI engineering, advanced exploratory analysis, and business-facing dashboards.

This project is part of my Data Analyst portfolio, demonstrating technical depth, analytical rigor, and business-oriented decision framing.

## Objectives

- Build a realistic streaming analytics dataset
- Clean, merge, and enrich multiple data sources
- Engineer meaningful KPIs for content evaluation
- Perform exploratory and advanced data analysis
- Create interactive BI dashboards for stakeholders
- Communicate insights clearly through visualizations and documentation

## Key Insights
These insights are derived from exploratory analysis, composite KPIs,
and cross-dimensional comparisons across genre, provider, and content maturity.

- Higher IMDb ratings correlate with completion, but not necessarily with total views
- Action and Sci-Fi act as acquisition drivers
- Animation and Comedy show highest rewatch behavior
- Some providers prioritize catalog scale over average content quality
- Engagement varies more by genre than by provider

### IMDb Rating vs Completion Rate
Bubble size represents total views, highlighting the relationship between perceived quality,
viewer engagement, and overall reach.

## Datasets
All datasets are synthetic but designed to reflect realistic streaming platform behaviors and distributions.

1. Titles
- title_id
- title_name
- genre
- release_year
- origin_country
- original_language
- duration_min
- age_rating
- imdb_rating
- provider
- is_original
- date_added

2. Users
- user_id
- country
- signup_date
- plan_type
- primary_device
- age
- gender
- is_active

3. Viewing Sessions
- view_id
- user_id
- title_id
- start_time
- watch_duration_min
- completed
- rewatch_flag
- device
- country

---

## KPI Engineering

From the enriched streaming catalog, the following KPIs are computed:

**Popularity Score**

A weighted metric combining:
- Total views
- Unique viewers
- Completion rate
- IMDb rating
- Rewatch rate

**Engagement Score**

Based on:
- Average watch duration vs title duration
- Completion rate
- Rewatch rate

**Recency**

Calculated as: `2025 - release_year`

**Maturity**

Derived from content age rating

---

## Notebooks

`01_exploration.ipynb`
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Merging titles, users, and viewing sessions
- Feature engineering and KPI computation

`02_visualizations.ipynb`
- Exploratory analysis of content performance
- Genre, provider, and engagement comparisons
- Initial insights and distributions

`03_advanced_visualizations.ipynb`
- Correlation matrix of key KPIs
- Bubble charts (IMDb vs Completion)
- Boxplots and heatmaps
- High-level KPI summaries by genre, provider, and maturity rating

---

## Power BI Dashboard

The interactive Power BI dashboard extends the notebook analysis into a structured, business-facing decision-support framework.

**Live version and full documentation:**  
See [`dashboard/README.md`](dashboard/README.md)

Built on the enriched dataset:

`data/processed/streaming_catalog_enriched.csv`

The dashboard translates engineered KPIs into strategic insights across six structured sections:

- Executive Overview of catalog performance  
- Provider benchmarking with Completion Lift vs global average  
- Genre efficiency and engagement comparison  
- Catalog Health metrics (Gini Index, concentration, distribution analysis)  
- Quality vs Consumption behavioral analysis  
- Content Strategy Matrix (Blockbusters, Hidden Gems, Guilty Pleasures, Underperformers)

### Strategic Metrics Highlight

- **Gini Index ≈ 0.06** → highly balanced catalog consumption  
- **~26% Underperformers** → potential optimization candidates  
- **Rewatch Index = 1.00** → stable engagement repetition  
- **High Non-US exposure** → diversified international footprint  

Compared to the static notebook visuals, the dashboard introduces:

- Dynamic performance segmentation logic  
- Median-based quadrant modeling  
- Gini coefficient implemented in DAX  
- Controlled filter-context benchmarking  
- Fully interactive slicer architecture
